				<p>As international adoptees (or parents of an adopted child), it is encouraged to double-check your citizenship status and ensure you have the necessary documentation to prove that you are U.S. citizens. </p>
				<p>Even if you possess a valid passport, it is recommended that you also have your Naturalization Certificate or Certificate of Citizenship. While a U.S. passport can be used to prove citizenship, it is not a USCIC-issued document that officially determines citizenship status.</p>
				<p>Additionally, you may have confusion as to which documents you should have, depending on when you were adopted.</p>
				<p>This tool will help international adoptees determine their citizenship and the steps to ensure they have the correct papers.</p>

				<h2>You may be an <u>adoptee without citizenship</u></h2>

				<blockquote>"Children who were 18 or older on February 27, 2001, did NOT acquire U.S. citizenship under the Child Citizenship Act. In recent years, many adoptees have found that although they were legally adopted and have been U.S. residents for most of their lives, they do not hold U.S. citizenship."</blockquote>
